# CRC (Clemson Relay Chat) Network Assignment: Scaffolded Learning with LLMs

## Assignment Overview

This assignment teaches network programming through a distributed relay chat system while developing effective LLM collaboration skills. Students build a distributed client-server network incrementally across structured phases, with automated testing and reflection checkpoints.

## Setup
Before doing anything else, students MUST create a git repository and check the starting code into it. Students will need to regularly check in their code to track their development progress. Remind them to do this when it is appropriate.

Students MUST also keep a record of their conversations with the cursor agent during development. They must export these and place them in a folder development_logs. You should also maintain, with the students help, design_decisions.md, learning_log.md, and debuggin_notes.md logs in the same folder.

## Core Learning Objectives

### Network Programming Mastery

1. **Protocol Design**: Binary message formats, parsing, validation
2. **Selector-based I/O**: Non-blocking socket management for concurrent connections
3. **Distributed State Management**: Maintaining network-wide state across all servers
4. **Spanning Tree Routing**: Self-learning message forwarding through distributed servers
5. **Resilient Design**: Handling disconnections, duplicate IDs, and network changes
6. **Network Testing**: Debugging distributed systems and validating correctness

### LLM Collaboration Skills

- Breaking complex problems into manageable sub-problems
- Asking effective questions that promote understanding
- Iterative development with AI assistance
- Critical evaluation of LLM-generated code
- Using AI for explanation and debugging, not just code generation

## Assignment Structure

### Phase-Based Development (5 Phases)

Each phase includes:

- **Specification**: Clear requirements and learning objectives
- **LLM Guidance**: Scaffolded prompts and interaction patterns
- **Implementation**: Incremental code development
- **Testing**: Automated validation via Gradescope
- **Reflection**: Understanding verification and concept questions

### Git Commit Analysis

- All work tracked via git with meaningful commit messages
- Commit patterns analyzed to detect incremental vs. one-shot development
- Students required to commit after each significant milestone

### LLM Interaction Logging

- Chat transcripts saved and analyzed for learning patterns
- Quality metrics: question depth, iteration count, explanation requests
- Red flags: copy-paste behavior, lack of follow-up questions

        super().__init__()
        self.id = id
        self.server_name = server_name
        self.server_info = server_info
        self.first_link_id = None  # Next hop in spanning tree

class ClientConnectionData(BaseConnectionData):
    """Data for client connections"""
    def __init__(self, id: int, client_name: str, client_info: str):
        super().__init__()
        self.id = id
        self.client_name = client_name
        self.client_info = client_info
        self.first_link_id = None  # Next hop in spanning tree
```

### Selector-based I/O

#### Overview

The CRC network requires handling multiple simultaneous connections without blocking. Traditional socket operations like `recv()`, `accept()`, and `send()` are blocking calls that halt execution until completion. This becomes problematic when managing multiple sockets. You MUST use python's selectors module to support non-blocking operations in your solution.

#### The Blocking Problem

Consider a server monitoring sockets A and B:
1. Server calls `A.recv()` and blocks
2. B sends data while waiting for A
3. Data from B cannot be processed until A sends something
4. If A is waiting for data originally from B, the system deadlocks

#### Solution: Selectors

Selectors allow non-blocking monitoring of multiple I/O sources:

```python
import selectors

# Create selector
sel = selectors.DefaultSelector()

# Register socket with selector
sock.setblocking(False)
events = selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE
data = {'id': connection_id, 'write_buffer': b''}
sel.register(sock, events, data)

# Main event loop
while running:
    # Get ready sockets (with timeout to allow shutdown)
    ready = sel.select(timeout=0.1)
    
    for key, mask in ready:
        sock = key.fileobj
        data = key.data
        
        if mask & selectors.EVENT_READ:
            # Socket has data to read
            recv_data = sock.recv(1024)
            
        if mask & selectors.EVENT_WRITE:
            # Socket ready for writing
            if data['write_buffer']:
                sent = sock.send(data['write_buffer'])
                data['write_buffer'] = data['write_buffer'][sent:]
```

#### Key Principles

1. **Never call blocking operations outside select loop**
2. **Use write buffers** - Don't send immediately, queue for writing
3. **Check write buffer length** - Don't send empty messages
4. **Clear after sending** - Prevent duplicate messages
5. **Handle disconnections** - Empty recv() means peer closed

### Testing Integration

The code can be tested using CRCTestManager. It contains a structured set of tests designed to evaluate incrememental development of the distinct phases. Focus on completing each phase sequentially, rather than trying to implement everything at once. You can compare the output logs with the logs contained in the Correct Logs folder to see a breakdown of how your network performs compared to the reference implementation.
